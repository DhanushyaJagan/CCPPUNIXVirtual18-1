 Pointer is a variable that stores memory addresses. Unlike normal variables it does not store user given or processed value, instead it stores valid computer memory address.


Pointer allows various magical things to be performed in C.

Pointers are more efficient in handling arrays and structures.
Pointers are used to return multiple values from a function.
Pointer allows dynamic memory allocation and deallocation (creation and deletion of variables at runtime) in C. Which undoubtedly is the biggest advantage of pointers.
Pointer allows to refer and pass a function as a parameter to functions.

 C program to accept five integer values from keyword.
sol)The five values will be stored in an array using a pointer. Then print the elements of the array on the screen. 
Solution: 
#include<stdio.h> 
#include<conio.h>   
   int main() 
    { 
     int arr[5],i; 
     int *p=arr; 
     printf("Enter five numbers separated by space:"); 
     scanf("%d%d%d%d%d",p,p+1,p+2,p+3,p+4); 
     printf("Your numbers are:\n"); 
     for(i=0;i<5;i++) 
        printf("%d\n",arr[i]);      
     getch(); 
     return 0;   
    }
